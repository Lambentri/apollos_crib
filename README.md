# ApollosCrib

A generalized automated data collection platform, for the purpose of collecting and displaying timely data for wherever you may be.

It supports the collection of data from 8 generalized sources at this time:

- GTFS (+RT)
- GBFS
- iCal
- Tidal
- Ephem
- AirNow
- OpenWeather
- Cronos

These can be formed into reusable queries against these sources into visions, and the ability to publish the result of these visions to relevant consumers via MQTT topics for downstream consumption.

## Public Demo

The public demo instance https://ac.gmp.io/ is here, and the landing data displays queries for various entities around Assembly Row, Somerville, MA, US
